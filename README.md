# Overview

Ebola Data Analysis In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of a 7.5 GB dataset on Ebola using Python and Apache Spark for big data computing. Initially, I deployed the application on Databricks for testing purposes to ensure robust performance and accurate results. After successful testing, I migrated the application to AWS for full-scale deployment. Utilizing AWS S3 for secure and scalable storage, and AWS EMR for enhanced computing power, I efficiently processed and analyzed the data. This deployment on AWS ensured scalability, reliability, and high performance, allowing for comprehensive statistical analysis and insights into the Ebola dataset.
